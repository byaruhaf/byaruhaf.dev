# About2

My name is Franklin and I'm a iOS developer, telecommunications Engineer and a occasional unicyclist.

I am passionate about problem-solving & Building things for iPhones and write about my experiences as a Developer here on this blog to document what I'm learning because the best way to learn is to practice, practice practice and then teach somebody what you have learned.
