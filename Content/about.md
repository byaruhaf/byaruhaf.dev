# About

Iâ€™m a Telecom engineer turned iOS Developer. I completed the Raywenderlich Bootcamp in May 2020. My iOS Developer journey is pretty young, transitioning from a 12-year career as a telecommunications engineer to an iOS developer.

I am passionate about problem-solving & Building things with swift and write about my experiences as a Developer here on this blog to document what I'm learning because the best way to learn is to practice, practice practice and then teach somebody what you have learned.
